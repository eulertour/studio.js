# Viewport Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the viewport rendering behavior updates as specified in `viewport.md`.

## Progress Status

### 1. Update `utils.ts`
- [ ] Add `ViewportSetupConfig` type definition
- [ ] Add `isViewportSetup` type guard function
- [ ] Update `SceneCanvasConfig` type to include `ViewportSetupConfig`
- [ ] Add viewport setup branch in `setupCanvas` function
- [ ] Implement aspectRatio calculation from viewport dimensions
- [ ] Implement coordinate dimension calculations
- [ ] Ensure canvas is not resized when viewport is provided
- [ ] Return computed aspectRatio from setupCanvas

### 2. Update `scene.ts`
- [ ] Modify SceneController constructor to handle aspectRatio from setupCanvas
- [ ] Ensure aspectRatio is stored when viewport is provided
- [ ] Ensure aspectRatio is stored when no viewport is provided (preserve current behavior)

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test rendering without viewport (should preserve current behavior)
- [ ] Test rendering with viewport and coordinateWidth
- [ ] Test rendering with viewport and coordinateHeight
- [ ] Verify aspectRatio is correctly computed from viewport dimensions
- [ ] Verify canvas is not resized when viewport is provided

## Current Status: Not Started
