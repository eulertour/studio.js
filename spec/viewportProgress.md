# Viewport Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the viewport rendering behavior updates as specified in `viewport.md`.

## Progress Status

### 1. Update `utils.ts`
- [x] Add `ViewportSetupConfig` type definition
- [x] Add `isViewportSetup` type guard function
- [x] Update `SceneCanvasConfig` type to include `ViewportSetupConfig`
- [ ] Add viewport setup branch in `setupCanvas` function
- [ ] Implement aspectRatio calculation from viewport dimensions
- [ ] Implement coordinate dimension calculations
- [ ] Ensure canvas is not resized when viewport is provided
- [ ] Return computed aspectRatio from setupCanvas

### 2. Update `scene.ts`
- [ ] Modify SceneController constructor to handle aspectRatio from setupCanvas
- [ ] Ensure aspectRatio is stored when viewport is provided
- [ ] Ensure aspectRatio is stored when no viewport is provided (preserve current behavior)

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test rendering without viewport (should preserve current behavior)
- [ ] Test rendering with viewport and coordinateWidth
- [ ] Test rendering with viewport and coordinateHeight
- [ ] Verify aspectRatio is correctly computed from viewport dimensions
- [ ] Verify canvas is not resized when viewport is provided

## Current Status: In Progress

### Completed:
- Added `ViewportSetupConfig` type that requires a viewport and either coordinateWidth or coordinateHeight
- Added `isViewportSetup` type guard that ensures exactly one coordinate dimension is provided
- Updated `SceneCanvasConfig` to include ViewportSetupConfig as a union type option

### Next Step:
- Add viewport setup branch in `setupCanvas` function to handle the new ViewportSetupConfig
