# Viewport Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the viewport rendering behavior updates as specified in `viewport.md`.

## Progress Status

### 1. Update `utils.ts`
- [x] Add `ViewportSetupConfig` type definition
- [x] Add `isViewportSetup` type guard function
- [x] Update `SceneCanvasConfig` type to include `ViewportSetupConfig`
- [x] Add viewport setup branch in `setupCanvas` function
- [x] Implement aspectRatio calculation from viewport dimensions
- [x] Implement coordinate dimension calculations
- [x] Ensure canvas is not resized when viewport is provided
- [x] Return computed aspectRatio from setupCanvas

### 2. Update `scene.ts`
- [x] Modify SceneController constructor to handle aspectRatio from setupCanvas
- [x] Ensure aspectRatio is stored when viewport is provided
- [x] Ensure aspectRatio is stored when no viewport is provided (preserve current behavior)

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test rendering without viewport (should preserve current behavior)
- [ ] Test rendering with viewport and coordinateWidth
- [ ] Test rendering with viewport and coordinateHeight
- [ ] Verify aspectRatio is correctly computed from viewport dimensions
- [ ] Verify canvas is not resized when viewport is provided

## Current Status: Implementation Complete

### Completed:
- Added `ViewportSetupConfig` type that requires a viewport and either coordinateWidth or coordinateHeight
- Added `isViewportSetup` type guard that ensures exactly one coordinate dimension is provided
- Updated `SceneCanvasConfig` to include ViewportSetupConfig as a union type option
- Added viewport setup branch in `setupCanvas` that:
  - Calculates aspectRatio from viewport dimensions (width/height)
  - Sets pixel dimensions from viewport dimensions
  - Calculates missing coordinate dimension from the provided one
  - Skips canvas resizing when viewport is provided
- Modified `setupCanvas` to return aspectRatio as the 4th element
- Updated SceneController to receive and store the aspectRatio from setupCanvas

### Summary of Changes:
The viewport rendering now works more intuitively:
- When no viewport is passed: Canvas is resized based on pixel dimensions, aspectRatio is taken from config
- When viewport is passed: Canvas is not resized, aspectRatio is computed from viewport dimensions, coordinate system matches viewport shape
